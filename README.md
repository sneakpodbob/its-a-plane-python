# Setup

## Installation
1. Assemble the RGB matrix, Pi, and Bonnet as described in [this Adafruit guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rgb-matrix-bonnet-for-raspberry-pi/overview). 
2. When complete, install the LED-matrix (rgbmatrix) python library, again as described in the [Adafruit installation guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rgb-matrix-bonnet-for-raspberry-pi/driving-matrices).
3. It is assumed the [solder bridge is added to the HAT](https://learn.adafruit.com/assets/57727) in order to use the Pi's soundcard to drive the device's PWM
4. Clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/ColinWaddell/its-a-plane-python`). 
5. Install the FlightRadarAPI dependency (`sudo pip3 install FlightRadarAPI`). Note - running with `sudo` is required as `rgbmatrix` [must be run as as root](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/tree/master/bindings/python#using-the-library) for best performance.
6. Go to the its-a-plane-python repo folder `cd its-a-plane-python` (or wherever you cloned it to). 
7. Add a config.py file as described below. 
8. Run `sudo python3 its-a-plane.py`.


## Configuration
In the root of the repo create a files `config.py` with the settings for your display.
* `ZONE_HOME` defines the area within which flights should be tracked. 
* `LOCATION_HOME` is the latitude/longitude of your home.
* `WEATHER_LOCATION` is the city that will be used to display the temperature. If using Openweather (see next), please type in the city in the form of "City" or "City,Province/State,Country", e.g. "Paris" or "Paris,Ile-de-France,FR".
* `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` If provided, will use the OpenWeather API. You can obtain a free OpenWeather API key by going [here](https://openweathermap.org/price) (Optional)
* `TEMPERATURE_UNITS` One of "metric" or "imperial". Defaults to "metric".
* `MIN_ALTITUDE` Will remove planes below a certain altitude (in feet). Depending on the defined ZONE_HOME, can be useful for filtering out planes parked on the tarmac.
* `BRIGHTNESS` 0-100, changes the brightness of the display. 
* `GPIO_SLOWDOWN` 0-4, larger numbers for faster hardware can reduce/eliminate flickering. (e.g., 2 seems to work well on a Pi Zero 2 W, but 0 might be fine for an older Pi Zero). 
* `JOURNEY_CODE_SELECTED` Three-letter airport code of local airport to put in **bold** on the display (Optional).
* `JOURNEY_BLANK_FILLER` Three-letter text to use in place of an unknown airport origin/destination. Defaults to " ? ".
* `HAT_PWM_ENABLED` Drive the PWM using the Pi's soundcard, [assuming the solder bridge has been added to the HAT](https://learn.adafruit.com/assets/57727). Defaults to `True`

```
ZONE_HOME = {
    "tl_y": 56.06403, # Top-Left Latitude (deg)
    "tl_x": -4.51589, # Top-Left Longitude (deg)
    "br_y": 55.89088, # Bottom-Right Latitude (deg)
    "br_x": -4.19694 # Bottom-Right Longitude (deg)
}
LOCATION_HOME = [
    55.9074356, # Latitude (deg)
    -4.3331678, # Longitude (deg)
    0.01781 # Altitude (km)

```


## Usage
If you are running a headless Pi that you are managing over `ssh`, you'll find that you have to remain connected for the display to keep running. A simple solution is to run the its-a-plane.py script in a `tmux` or `screen` session. For instance:
1. ssh to the Pi.
2. `sudo apt-get install tmux`
3. Once installed, start a new session by running the command `tmux`.
4. Run `sudo python3 /path/to/its-a-plane.py`. 
5. Detach from the tmux session by pressing Ctrl+B and then pressing D. 
6. `logout` to exit the Pi. Note that you'll need to re-enter or kill the tmux session to modify/stop the display. 

A more permanent solution if you'd like the software to run automatically on boot is to add it to your `/etc/rc.local`
1. ssh to the Pi.
2. Edit `/etc/rc.local` - for example `sudo nano -w /etc/rc.local`
3. Add a line pointing to the location this software is installed. In the following example some logging is provided for debugging purposes:
```
/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/its-a-plane-python/its-a-plane.py > /home/pi/plane.log 2>&1 &
```

## Optional

### Loading LED
An LED can be wired to a GPIO on the Raspberry Pi which can then blinks when data is being loaded.

To enabled this add the following to your `config.py`. Adjust `LOADING_LED_GPIO_PIN` to suit your setup.

```
LOADING_LED_ENABLED = True
LOADING_LED_GPIO_PIN = 25
```

If you are using `rc.local` to load this software on boot and you see the error `RuntimeError: No access to /dev/mem.  Try running as root!` then you need to update your `rc.local` to launch the application using `sudo`

```
sudo /usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/its-a-plane-python/its-a-plane.py > /home/pi/plane.log 2>&1 &
```

### Rainfall chart
If weather data is being pulled from the original authors server (as opposed to using `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`) then you can
display a chart of rainfall by adding the following to your `config.py`:

```
RAINFALL_ENABLED = True
```
